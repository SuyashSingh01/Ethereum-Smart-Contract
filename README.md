# Ethereum Smart Contract

Welcome to the Ethereum Smart Contract Problem Repository! This repository contains a collection of problem statements and corresponding smart contract solutions for various Ethereum-based applications.

## Overview

In this repository, you'll find problem statements addressing different use cases and objectives for Ethereum smart contracts. Each problem statement is accompanied by a solution in the form of a Solidity smart contract.

## Contents

The repository is organized into folders, each representing a specific problem statement. Inside each folder, you'll find the following files:

1. **Problem_Statement.md**: This file contains the detailed description of the problem statement, including objectives, requirements, and constraints.

2. **Solution_Contract.sol**: This file contains the Solidity smart contract solution to the corresponding problem statement. The contract is thoroughly commented to explain its functionality and implementation details.

3. **README.md**: This file provides additional information and instructions specific to the problem statement and its solution. It may include usage guidelines, gas optimization strategies, and other relevant details.

## How to Use

To get started with a specific problem statement, navigate to the corresponding folder and review the `Problem_Statement.md` file to understand the requirements. Then, examine the `Solution_Contract.sol` file to explore the smart contract solution.

Feel free to modify and experiment with the provided smart contract solutions to further your understanding of Ethereum smart contract development.
